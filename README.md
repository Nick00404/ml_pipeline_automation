# 🔧 ML Pipeline Automation

Welcome to the **ML Pipeline Automation** project! This repository demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning pipeline that automates the process from data ingestion to model deployment.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project aims to streamline the machine learning workflow by automating key stages, including:

- **Data Ingestion**: Efficiently loading datasets from various sources.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming data to make it suitable for modeling.
- **Model Training**: Implementing and training machine learning models.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using appropriate metrics.
- **Model Deployment**: Deploying the trained model for inference.

## 🧩 Key Features

- **Modular Architecture**: Each component of the pipeline is encapsulated in separate modules for clarity and maintainability.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle datasets of varying sizes and complexities.
- **Extensibility**: Easily extendable to incorporate additional stages or models.
- **Automation**: Utilizes automation tools to streamline repetitive tasks.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language for implementing the pipeline.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and numerical computations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
- **Flask**: For creating a simple web API to serve the model.
- **Docker**: To containerize the application for consistent environments.
- **GitHub Actions**: For continuous integration and deployment workflows.

## 🚦 Getting Started

To set up and run the pipeline locally:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nick00404/ml_pipeline_automation.git
   cd ml_pipeline_automation
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # On Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the Flask application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. Access the application at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## 🧪 Usage

Once the application is running, you can interact with the model through the API endpoints defined in `app.py`. For example, you can send a POST request with a JSON payload containing the input features, and receive the model's prediction in response.

## 📈 Future Enhancements

- **Model Monitoring**: Implement tools to monitor model performance over time.
- **Model Retraining**: Automate the retraining process when new data becomes available.
- **Advanced Deployment**: Explore deploying the model using cloud services like AWS or GCP.
- **User Interface**: Develop a user-friendly interface for non-technical users to interact with the model.
